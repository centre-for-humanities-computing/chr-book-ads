###

This repository contains code for embeddings, plots and results of our paper: 

"Reading Beyond the Center. Modeling Book Encounters in the Danish Periphery (1800-1850)" which will be presented at CHR2025.

## Useful directions 📌

Some useful directions:

- `/data/` contains saved embeddings (.json) used for the analysis
- `/figs/` contains the figures generated by the notebooks
- `/latex_tables/` contains code for the LaTeX tables in the paper
- `/notebooks/` contains the notebooks used for the analysis
- `/results/` contains results of the experiments


## Data & paper 📝

The dataset used in this paper is available at [huggingface](https://huggingface.co/datasets/chcaa/chr-book-ads-articles), which is an earlier version and subset of this [dataset](https://huggingface.co/datasets/JohanHeinsen/ENO).

The trained embeddings are also available at [huggingface](https://huggingface.co/datasets/chcaa/periphery-aviser-e5).

Please cite our [paper](link coming soon) if you use the code, dataset or embeddings:
